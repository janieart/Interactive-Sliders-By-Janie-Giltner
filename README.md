# Interactive Micro Slider by [Janieart.com](https://Janieart.com)

A lightweight bare-bones (naked) yet powerful WordPress slider plugin with advanced micro-interactions, smooth animations, and a user-friendly admin panel. Touch/swipe support, auto-play, responsive design, and performance optimization — all in one simple package without bloat. 
A Plugin so streamlined and yet beautiful to build upon.

1 PHP file does it all!

## Installation Instructions

1. Save the code as `interactive-micro-slider.php`.  
2. Create a folder named `interactive-micro-slider` in `/wp-content/plugins/`.  
3. Place the PHP file inside that folder.  
4. In WordPress Admin, go to **Plugins → Installed Plugins**.  
5. Activate **Interactive Micro Slider by Janieart.com**.  
6. Access the admin panel via the new **“Sliders”** menu.  

That’s it! 🎉

## Usage

Create sliders directly in the **WordPress Admin Panel**.  
Each slider you create will have a shortcode you can copy and paste anywhere.

## Shortcodes and why this slider rocks!

```php
[interactive_slider id="1"]

Build sliders right inside the Admin Panel (no coding headaches). Each slider gives you a shortcode — just copy, paste, and enjoy.

Your Basic Slider
[interactive_slider id="1"]

Add Some Flair
[interactive_slider id="1" height="400px"]
[interactive_slider id="1" autoplay="false"]
